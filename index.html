        <h1>Ten One Tea House Ordering Kiosk</h1>
        <h2>A Personas & Storyboarding Case Study</h2>
    
        <p>
          This is a case study on the usability, learnability, memorability, and
          effectiveness of ordering kiosks at establishments. The main focus of this
          study will be the ordering kiosk at Ten One Tea House which is intended to
          make it quick and easy for customers to browse the menu and place orders
          as opposed to waiting in line for the register.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <img src="images/tenone.png" alt="Ten One Main Menu" class="center" />
      <!-- <img src="images/hollister_3.png" alt="Hollister Hovered" class="center" style="display:inline-block;"> -->
      <p>
        This is the online menu the kiosk provides. Items are categorized by
        type of drink/flavor to make it easier for users to navigate. Each
        drink/menu item also has images displayed, so users can see what they
        can expect to receive after placing their order. Each item also has a
        description of what the drink is. This is more helpful compared to a
        menu board where customers can only see item name and price listed.
      </p>

        <p>
          To gain a better understanding of how well the kiosk is designed, I
          interviewed and observed a handful of customers at Ten One Tea House
          and made notes about how they interacted with the interface. Most
          users seem fairly comfortable and agreed the kiosk was easy to use. In
          addition to behavioral notes, I asked each interviewee to fill out a
          short survey about their experience to collect data about attitudes.
        </p>
        <h3>Questions included:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>How often do you get boba?</li>
          <li>
            Please rate the difficulty of using this kiosk on a scale of 1-5
          </li>
          <li>
            Why did you choose to order at the kiosk instead of the register?
          </li>
          <li>
            Did you encounter any challenges while placing your order? Is there
            anything you would change about the design of this kiosk?
          </li>
        </ul>
